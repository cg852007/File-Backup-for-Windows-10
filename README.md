<h1>File-Backup-for-Windows-10</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtube.com/)

<h2>Description</h2>
I wanted to start backing up my PC and phone. After some reseach I've decided to back them up physically and to the clould. I will use image backup and file backup for my physical storage options. A file backup copies your data files (photos, documents, etc.). An image backup will copy everything on your drive including boot sector, partions, programs, and settings. This will show how I back up my PC with file backup.

You can always reinstall applications(Image backup), but not your family photos(File backup).

Under "Back up using File History" turn the switch to On (If it's your first time you'll be prompted to select the drive you wish to use). The files will backup automatically every hour. Under it you have "more options" click this to customize further: <br/>
